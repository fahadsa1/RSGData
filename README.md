# RSGData: Hybrid FSO/RF Link Deployment - Red Sea Global

This repository contains performance and environmental data collected over a 6-month period for the evaluation of hybrid Free Space Optics (FSO) and Radio Frequency (RF) links deployed at Red Sea Global.

## Overview

This dataset was gathered from February 7, 2024, to June 13, 2024, and was used to assess link performance under varying weather conditions. The data has been cleaned and processed to support performance evaluation and link availability analysis.

## Publication

The results and findings from this data analysis are presented in our paper, *"Overcoming Maritime Connectivity Challenges with Hybrid RF/FSO Links,"* by Fahad S. Alqurashi, Salah Abdeljabar, Abderrahmen Trichili, and Mohamed-Slim Alouini.
